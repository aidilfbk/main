== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== [Proposed] Finding Free Timeslot feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The finding free timeslot feature is implemented by `ScheduleGenerator`. It generates the current `WeekSchedule` of a group and the common free timeslot among its members and updates the `ScheduleView` to be displayed to the user. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ScheduleGenerator#getFreeTimeslot()` -- Generates a `personSchedule` of a group and updates the `ScheduleView`.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getFreeTimeslot()`

Firstly, the `getFreeTimeslot()` method takes in as input an ArrayList of `Person` and updates the ScheduleView of the TimeBook. When the method is executed, it checks the schedule of each `Person` in the TimeBook and generates a new combined `WeekSchedule` of the whole list of `Person`. Also, only `TimeSlots` that are within the week are checked and put into the 'WeekSchedule'. The generated `WeekSchedule` will then contain the individual schedules of each `Person` in the list for the week.

After the `WeekSchedule` has been generated, the method now generates a new schedule of the free timeslots within the `WeekSchedule`. It checks the `WeekSchedule` and generates a new `FreeTimeSchedule` with contains all the timeslots in which there are no clashes with the `personSchedule`. It also only generates `FreeTimeslots` for the week.

Additionally, the generated `FreeTimeSchedule` also contains the information of the last venue the `Person` has been. This information is then used to calculate the closest location for all `Person` to meet.

Finally, after generating the `WeekSchedule` and `FreeTimeSchedule`, it now updates the `ScheduleView` of `TimeBook`. This 'ScheduleView' is then displayed to the user through the UI.

The following sequence diagram shows how the generateFreeTimeslot operation works:

image::FindFreeTimeslotSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the `WeekSchedule` is generated and stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Generates the `WeekSchedule` only when the `ShowGroup` command is executed.
** Pros: Saves memory space, and does not need to compute the `WeekSchedule` of every group upon startup.
** Cons: May have performance issues in runtime as there is no preprocessing as the `WeekSchedule` is only generated when required.
* **Alternative 2:** Upon startup, generate each Group's `WeekSchedule` and store them within the `Group` object.
** Pros: Better runtime performance as the `WeekSchedule` is already generated.
** Cons: Will have perfomance issues in terms of memory usage. Each Group's `WeekSchedule` will also have to be updated whenever a `Person` is added, edited or deleted.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::suggestions[]
[#command-suggestions]
=== Command Suggestions feature
// tag::suggestions-implementation[]
==== Implementation

The command suggestions mechanism is facilitated by `SuggestionLogic`.
Through user-interface events provided by `SuggestingCommandBox`, it parses the command that was entered to provide context-sensitive suggestions.

It does this by identifying the `commandWord` (e.g. `deleteperson`, `addperson`, etc.) and `arguments` provided (e.g. `n/Alice`, `g/CS2103T`) and by using the caret position, provides command suggestions if the caret is located within the `commandWord` section or provides argument-specific suggestions by delegating to the ``Suggester`` registered for the specific `commandWord`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command suggestions mechanism behaves at each step. Ultimately, this is what the user will see:

.Example of the command suggestions mechanism
image::command-suggestions/developer-guide-caret-within-arguments.png[width=50%]
{nbsp} +
Step 1. The user types in the command `deleteperson n/|` and the `SuggestingCommandBox` UI class passes the command text (i.e. `deleteperson n/`) and the caret position index (i.e. 15) to `SuggestionLogic`.

NOTE: The vertical line/pipe character (i.e. `|`) denotes the position of the caret and is not part of the entered command itself. +
So for the above example, the command entered is `deleteperson n/` with the caret at the end of the command.

.The `SuggestingCommandBox` UI class passing UI data to the `SuggestionLogic` class to obtain suggestions.
image::command-suggestions/Step1.svg[]
{nbsp} +

Step 2. The `SuggestionLogic` asks the `TimeBookParser` to tokenize the command text into its two parts: the `commandWord` and the `arguments`. This is needed so the `SuggestionLogic` knows which `Suggester` to use later.

.Tokenization of the command entered by the user
image::command-suggestions/Step2.svg[]
{nbsp} +

[#command-suggestions-caret-within-arguments]
Step 3. The `SuggestionLogic` then checks where the caret is currently positioned, either within the `commandWord` or within the `arguments` section. In this case, the caret is placed after the `n/` so it is within the `arguments` section. link:#command-suggestions-caret-within-commandWord[To read how the behaviour changes if the caret was placed within the `commandWord` section, click here.]

.The tokenized command and its caret indices
image::command-suggestions/Step3.svg[width=50%]
{nbsp} +

Step 4. The `SuggestionLogic` asks the static `Suggester` class which ``Prefix``es are supported by the current `commandWord` (i.e. `deleteperson`) for tokenizing the `arguments`. This list of supported ``Prefix``es, together with the command `arguments`, are passed to the static `ArgumentTokenizer` to parse it into an `ArgumentList` containing ``CommandArgument``s. Each `CommandArgument` contains the type of `Prefix` and the user-entered value.

.Tokenizing the given arguments
image::command-suggestions/Step4.svg[]
{nbsp} +

Step 5. The `SuggestionLogic` then asks the static `Suggester` class to create the relevant `Suggester` object based on the `commandWord`. In this case, the static `Suggester` class returns a new `DeletePersonSuggester` because the `commandWord` is `deleteperson`.

.Creating the relevant `Suggester`
image::command-suggestions/Step5.svg[]
{nbsp} +

Step 6. The `SuggestionLogic` asks the `ArgumentList` object which `CommandArgument` is currently selected based on the user's caret position. In this case, it is the `CommandArgument` with the `Prefix` of `PERSON_NAME` and `value` of an empty string because the caret is positioned within the `n/` text and no value has been entered.

.Calculating which `CommandArgument` is currently selected
image::command-suggestions/Step6.svg[]
{nbsp} +

Step 7. The `SuggestionLogic` asks for the suggestions from the `DeletePersonSuggester` by providing three things to it. First, the current `Model` object, second the previously parsed `ArgumentList` object and finally, the `CommandArgument` to provide suggestions for. After obtaining the list of suggestions, the `SuggestionLogic` class returns it to the `SuggestingCommandBox` UI class for display.

.Obtaining and displaying suggestions

The following sequence diagram condenses all the above diagrams into one, given the input `deleteperson n/|`:

.Full sequence diagram for input `deleteperson n/|`
image:command-suggestions/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.svg[]
{nbsp} +

[#command-suggestions-caret-within-commandWord]
The `SuggestionLogic` behaves differently when the caret position is within the `commandWord` section. The sequence diagram below shows the behaviour for the case of `find|person n/`. link:#command-suggestions-caret-within-arguments[To read how the behaviour changes if the caret was placed within the `arguments` section, click here.]

The result is the following:

// end::suggestions-implementation[]

// tag::suggestions-design-considerations[]
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How command suggestions gets its suggestions

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Ask ``Suggester``s for suggestions every time anything changes
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of CPU and memory usage as ``Suggester``s are created and run every time the command changes or the caret is moved.
* **Alternative 2:** Cache suggestions based on entered command and caret position
** Pros: Will use less CPU, may use less memory.
** Cons: Difficult to properly account for all the conditions that should cause a cache invalidation/recalculation of suggestions.

===== Aspect: Data structure to pass around the command arguments

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create an `ArgumentList` to store the ordered sequence of arguments.
** Pros: Provides ``Suggester``s with flexibility in providing suggestions since the relative ordering of arguments is preserved. For example, it is possible to suggest different values for each `class/` argument based on the left-closest `mod/` argument for the following command: `addmod n/Alice mod/CS2103T class/ mod/CS2101 class/`.
** Cons: Increased complexity in extracting command arguments for simpler ``Suggester``s.
* **Alternative 2:** Reuse `ArgumentMultimap`
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate data structure due to reuse, and developers familiar with how `ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize()` works for writing a `Command` can transfer their knowledge when writing ``Suggester``s for their own commands.
** Cons: ``Suggester``s are restricted in terms of the flexibility of their suggestions, as they lack info about the relative ordering of all the arguments.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Visual Representation of individual's or group's schedule
A separate class `ScheduleView` will be created to facilitate the creation of the schedule view belonging to individuals and groups.
Depending on the constructor used in this class, different types of schedules will be shown. There are two types of constructors:
* `ScheduleView(WeekSchedule personSchedule)` This constructor is used to construct a schedule view of an individual.
* `ScheduleView(List<WeekSchedule> personSchedules, List<String> colors, WeekSchedule freeSchedule)` This constructor is used to construct a schedule view of a group

These methods are used in the MainWindow class, where MainWindow will display instances of ScheduleView when various commands
are performed.

Given below is an example of how the Nodes (containers) in MainWindow changes with respect to the show command.

Step 1. After the user launches the application, the MainWindow will consist of 4 main Nodes: `CommandBox`, `TabsPanel`, `ResultDisplay` and `DefaultDetailWindow`.

image::VisualRepresentationCD0.png[]

Step 2a. Suppose the user has a friend named Ben in the application. The user executes `show n/ Ben` in order to view Ben's details
and his schedule. The state of MainWindow will now have another set of 4 Nodes: `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ScheduleView` and `PersonDetailCard`.

image::VisualRepresentationCD1.png[]

Step 2b. Alternatively, suppose the user has a group named CS2103T team project. The user executes `show g/ CS2103T team project` in
order to view the group's schedule and information. The state of MainWindow will now have a different set of 4 Nodes: `CommandBox`, `ScheduleView`,
`ResultDisplay` and `GroupInformation`

image::VisualRepresentationCD2.png[]

[NOTE]
If the user keys in a name or group that is not present in the application, a CommandException will be thrown to indicate
that such name or group is not found in the application.

The following sequence diagram shows how the show command eventually lead to changes in the UI to show the visual representation
of an individual's or group's schedule.

image::VisualRepresentationSD0.png[]
image::VisualRepresentationSD1.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: User experience of the schedule view.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a separate container for headers and schedule contents (table cells & blocks).
** Pros: User can read the schedule in our application a lot more easier.
** Cons: Duplicated codes in the ScheduleView class to generate the separate containers.
* **Alternative 2:** A single container to contain the schedule view.
** Pros: Easier to implement, lesser lines of codes.
** Cons: UX will decrease due to increase difficulty to read schedules in the application.

===== Aspect: Amount of detail present in schedule view.
* **Alternative 1:** Enable users to see schedules up to 1 week in advance.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Users may experience difficulty to plan meetings 2 or more weeks in advance.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Enable users to see schedules up to 4 weeks in advance.
** Pros: Most users will be able to plan most of their meetings. (Up to 1 month in advance).
** Cons: Slightly more challenging to implement in order to make sure that the schedule view is not cluttered.

===== Aspect: Color schemes for time slot blocks in schedule view.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Select 10 good contrast colours to dark theme for schedules.
** Pros: More aesthetically pleasing to the user.
** Cons: Groups that have more than 10 members will have the same colours for their schedule.
* **Alternative 2:** Randomly generate colours depending on group size.
** Pros: All members in a group will very likely have different colours to indicate their schedule.
** Cons: Schedules with darker colours cannot be seen from a dark theme UI.

[[Implementation-ClosestLocation]]
=== Closest Common Location(Micro Service)
Closest common location utilises Google Maps Api to get the closest common location among a group of various location in NUS.

==== Definition

* Due to connectivity constraints, we cannot support location outside of NUS. All locations have to follow the spelling and format in NUSMods.
* The closest location is the location that has the least average travelling time by car from the various sources.
* All invalid location are omitted during as the source location will not be considered.

==== Algorithm

. Create a complete graph where the vertices are the different locations in NUS and edges are the respective travelling time by car from location `u` to `v`
. Represent this graph in a v x v matrix where `i` represents the source location and `j` represent destination location and `distanceMatrix[i][j]` represent the time needed to travel from `i` to `j`
. To get the closest common location of S1 ... Sn:
.. Get the rows i = S1 ... Sn
.. Sum the values of the rows to a new row `totalDistance`
.. The smallest value in the row is the closest common location

==== Implementation

Overview of the implementation

image::gmaps/GmapsArchitectureDiagram.png[]

There are 3 main aspects to the implementation

. External API
. Creating the matrix
. Getting the closest location

===== External API

To support the limited internet connection, we preprocess the relevant data and save it into the resources directory (See <<External APIs, External APIs>>).

==== Creating matrix

This is the sequence diagram for the creation of the matrix.


image::gmaps/MatrixCreationSequenceDiagram.png[]

*Brief overview*
The initialising of the matrix is broken into 2 steps. The first step is to get the list of locations in NUSMods and
checking against google maps API if that location is identifiable by google. The second step is to use the identifiable
location to construct the matrix.

*Steps*

. Check if the name of the location in NUSMods is identifiable on google maps
.. Call NUSMods api with `Cache#loadVenues`
.. Sanitize the location name given by NUSMods by appending `NUS_` to the front and removing any characters after `-`
as the room in the building does not matter
. Construct matrix.
.. Get the list of sanitized locations and split into blocks of 10. This is because Google Maps API constraint to
at most 10 x 10 matrix. Construct the n x n matrix by calling google maps Distance Matrix API.

==== Getting closest location

This is the sequence diagram for when the method `Model.getClosestLocationData` and `Model.getClosestLocationString`

// tag::nusmods[]
=== Add NUSMods To Schedule
==== Implementation
This feature allows users to add their NUSMods timetable (using the `AddNusModsCommand`) to their TimeBook schedules.

The `AddNusModsCommand` can be executed by the user through the CLI with the following syntax `addmods n/NAME link/NUSMODS_SHARE_LINK`. The share link contains semester number, module codes and lesson numbers, which are used for creating and adding events to the person's schedule.

//The following class diagrams shows the structure of `Module` and `Event`:
//TODO: class diagram for Module and Event

The following sequence diagram shows what happens when `AddNusModsCommand` is executed:

image::nusmods/AddNusModsSequenceDiagram.png[]

. User enters `addmods n/NAME link/https//nusmods.com/...`
. The name string will be parsed into a `Name` object. The argument string for link will be parsed in `AddNusModsCommandParser` into a `NusModsShareLink`, containing the `SemesterNo`, `ModuleCodes` and `LessonNos`. Both the `Name` and `NusModsShareLink` objects will then be passed into the `AddNusModsCommand` constructor.
. The `AddNusModsCommand#execute` is then called by the `LogicManager`.
. In the `AddNusModsCommand#execute` method,
.. `model#findPerson` is called to find the `Person` with the provided name.
.. Iterate through the `ModuleCodes`,
... Call `model#findModule` to get the `Module` with the given module code.
... Pass the module and selected lesson numbers in the link into `ModuleEventMappingUtil#mapModuleToEvent` to generate an `Event` based on the module. The lesson numbers are used to generate the `Timeslots` for the event.
.. Iterate through all the events to add,
... Call `person#addEvent` to add the event to the person's schedule.
. Return command result and display feedback to user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Ease of executing command as user.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Entering NUSMods share link
** Pros: User can easily get the NUSMods share link of his/her existing NUSMods timetable and copy/paste the link into the command.
** Cons: Less flexibility if user wants to add only some modules (has to adjust timetable on NUSMods or modify the link itself)
* **Alternative 2:** Entering modules individually
** Pros: More flexibility in specifying modules to add.
** Cons: Tedious as user has to specify the semester, module codes and lesson numbers in the command.
* **Alternative 3:** Importing the downloaded iCalendar file from NUSMods
** Pros: Opens up the possibility of importing generic iCalendar files.
** Cons: User is unlikely to be able to get the iCalendar files of his/her group members (due to tediousness and privacy reasons).

// end::nusmods[]


// tag::websocket[]
=== External APIs

The application requires data from the https://api.nusmods.com/v2/[NUSMods API] for the <<Add NUSMods To Schedule, Add NUSMods To Schedule>> feature and data from the https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation[Google Maps API] for the <<Closest Common Location(Micro Service), Closest Common Location>> feature. The following subsections describe the implementation of various aspects with regards to working with external APIs:

==== APIs

We have implemented a `websocket` component to contain the logic of interfacing with external APIs.

The `websocket.NusModsApi` class contains methods for querying different endpoints of the NUSMods API and parsing the query results into `JSONObject` or `JSONArray` objects.

The `websocket.GmapsApi` class contains methods for querying different endpoints of the Google Maps API and parsing the query results into `JSONObject` or `JSONArray` objects.
//TODO: describe more and provide a class diagram of the internal classes in websocket

==== Caching API Results

To support limited connectivity in our application, the results of all API queries are preprocessed and saved into the resources directory. The following activity diagram shows how the caching feature works when external data is required for the execution of a certain command:

==== Preprocessing NUSMods API
The key information that we require for each NUS module is the timetable information. Unfortunately, there is no available endpoint which provides the timetable information of all modules at once - there is only an endpoint which provides the timetable information of one module per query. Thus, we developed a small program in `logic.internal.nusmods.ImportMods`, which can be run prior to the main application itself, to query the timetable info for every module and build a list of modules data containing the timetable information.

//TODO: insert diagram websocket - logic.internal.nusmods class diagram

==== Preprocessing Google Maps API
//TODO: talk about your internal program to build the DistanceMatrix.json / Places.json


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Limited Connectivity Support
Current choice: we chose a combination of alternatives 1 and 2 to achieve robust limited connectivity support for our external API data.

* **Alternative 1:** Preprocessing API
** Pros: Can achieve complete offline support, also saves the issue of handling API keys.
** Cons: Have to run preprocessing programs from time to time to update data files, e.g. for modules in new academic year or new locations else features will not work.
* **Alternative 2:** Caching Query Results
** Pros: Achieves limited connectivity support (call once and save result, then use saved result for future calls). Also, needs less work to support future data/API changes.
** Cons: Not so useful in cases where a large number of queries is required to be preprocessed first, e.g. getting locations data from Google Maps API to generate `LocationGraph`.
* **Alternative 3:** Direct API queries
** Pros: Easy to implement, minimal work to support future data/API changes.
** Cons: No limited connectivity support.
